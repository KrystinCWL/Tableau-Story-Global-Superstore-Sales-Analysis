This project analyzes global sales, profitability, customer segments, and product performance using the Global Superstore dataset.
A five-page Tableau Story was created to communicate insights through interactive dashboards, static charts, and data-driven storytelling.

The dashboards demonstrate:  
* KPI tracking and geographic drill-down  
* Market & Region-level trend analysis  
* Profitability vs Returns risk assessment  
* Category contribution visualization (Waffle charts)  
* Sub-category growth comparison  
* Discount vs Sales behavioral patterns

## 📊 Key Insights

Technology outperformed other categories in most markets since 2011.

Some sub-categories (e.g., Tables, Bookcases) consistently show negative profit despite large sales volumes.

Several regions (EU South, LATAM North) suffer from high return rates → significant profit loss.

Discount does not always drive sales; high-discount orders often reduce profit margin dramatically.

Shipping mode strongly affects sales distribution (Standard makes up nearly 60%).
